Nausea,"Moderate Dehydration - Dry mouth, tongue, lips",,,"Perinatal transmission can occur during pregnancy, and peripartum maternal infection may increase the likelihood of symptomatic infection in the newborn.",tenderness,Take acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol outside of the United States) to control fever and relieve pain.,,,"Provide fluids such a water, juice, milk, or drinks with added electrolytes.",,,Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte replacement,"Expenses from Private Not-for-profit hospital in rupees, median(IQR) values(dengue with warning sign - adults) - 18,555 (13,628–25,151)","For people who get sick with dengue, symptoms can be mild or severe","When treated, severe dengue has a mortality rate of 2%-5%, but, when left untreated, the mortality rate is as high as 20%.",,Keep mosquitoes outside: Use screens on windows and doors.,"Immunoglobulin M (IgM) - This test looks for IgM (antibodies) in the blood, which appear in the early course of the disease (acute infection). The test can also help to differentiate between primary (first time infection) and secondary (second time infection with any of the dengue virus) infection. It is advised to undergo a dengue antibody IgM test, if you are experiencing symptoms of dengue for more than a week or 10 days.This test is not advised if you have a secondary dengue infection.",Is dengue contagious from person to person?,"No, dengue is not contagious and cannot be spread merely by person to person contact. The dengue virus is carried and transmitted by mosquitoes. If a mosquito bites someone with dengue, and then bites another person, the second person can get infected. This is usually how dengue spreads and can sometimes become an epidemic."

Dengue is caused by four different viral strains and infection with one virus does not protect a person against infection from the other three strains. Hence one can be infected by dengue four times. Subsequent infections increase the risk for the most serious forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome."

Can one die from dengue fever?,"Although dengue fever is a serious and often painful condition, it is not a deadly disease and does not lead to death. With proper care, most people infected with dengue usually make a full recovery unless complications occur. These complications may include Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). In some of these cases death can occur but is rare. With proper care and treatment, even patients with DHF or DSS can make a full recovery. Hospitalization is highly recommended in cases of DHF or DSS and greatly increases the chances of survival."

nose bleed,,,,,"Feeling tired, restless, or irritable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,How can we prevent epidemics of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)?,Development of an effective vaccine against the dengue virus is the most promising solution. Others are eradication of the Aedes aegypti vector and spraying ultra-low volume (ULV) insecticides to kill adult mosquitoes. Both methods have not been viable.

A positive IgM plus negative IgG will indicate a recent primary dengue infection while a positive IgG with a positive or negative IgM will indicate an infection that has occured in the past."
"Aches and pains (eye pain, typically behind the eyes, muscle, joint, or bone pain)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What is Dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF ) and dengue shock syndrome ( DSS)?","Dengue infection is caused by a virus. It occurs commonly as dengue fever. Occasionally the patient suffering from dengue may develop bleeding from common sites like nose, gums or skin. Sometimes, the patient may have coffee ground vomiting or black coal tar like stools. It indicates bleeding from gastro- intestinal tract. The dengue fever with bleeding is called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). It can be fatal if it remains unrecognized and not properly treated. Rarely the patient suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) may develop shock, then it is called dengue shock syndrome (DSS)."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When should Dengue be suspected?,"Dengue should be suspected when a person has sudden onset of fever. The fever is usually high 103-105 degrees F or 39-40 degrees C. It is accompanied with severe headache (mostly in the forehead), pain behind the eyes, body aches and pains, rash on the skin and nausea or vomiting. The fever lasts for 5-7 days. In some patients, fever comes down on 3rd or 4th day but comes back. All the above symptoms and signs may not be present in the patient. The patient feels much discomfort after the illness"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What can the society do to prevent dengue?,"The main strategy in the prevention and control of dengue is ""source reduction"", or prevention of breeding places. Community participation is the key to dengue prevention. Prevention of dengue relies heavily on preventing the mosquito breeding inside and in the vicinity of our homes. Every household should undertake simple measures to prevent water collections from becoming places for mosquito breeding by draining out water , by regular changing of water , cleaning flower vases and other water holding items or, in the case of unused items, by discarding/destroying them. The mosquito does not travel far, therefore "" every house cleaning"" will ensure that no breeding places exist, preventing dengue from occurring"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What should the doctors treating dengue do ?,Patients suspected to be suffering from dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome should be admitted to a hospital without delay. The progress of these patients should be monitored regularly at 1-2 hours interval. Platelet counts and haematocrits should be monitored repeatedly to review the progress of patients. If the haematocrit levels fall dangerously then a blood transfusion should be considered. A fall of more than 20 % as compared to previous levels may be an indication for transfusion.If the haematocrit values rise the patient should be given fluids intravenously and the fluids carefully monitored to ensure that the patient does not get excess fluids. A rise of more than 20 % as compared to previous levels may be an indication for IV fluids. The doctor would decide based on best judgement of patient's condition.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Are there any long term ill effects of dengue fever?,"Most people who suffer from dengue fever recover in 1-2 weeks time. Some may feel tired for several weeks. However, if symptoms persist after this period, consult a doctor."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What are the warning signs and symptoms in dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) ?,"Generally the dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome occur after 3-5 days of fever. By this time, fever has often come down. This may mislead many of us to believe that the patient is heading towards recovery. In fact, this is the most dangerous period that requires high vigilance from care-givers. The signs and symptoms that should be looked for are severe pain abdomen, persistent vomiting, bleeding from any site like, bleeding in the skin appearing as small red or purplish spots, nose bleed, bleeding from gums, passage of black stools like coal tar. Take the patient to the hospital whenever the first two signs, namely, severe pain in the abdomen and persistent vomiting are detected. Usually it is too late if we wait until bleeding has occurred. The most dangerous type of dengue is the dengue shock syndrome. It is recognized by signs like excessive thirst, pale and cold skin (due to very low blood pressure), restlessness and a feeling of weakness."
