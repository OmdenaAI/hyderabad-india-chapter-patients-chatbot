The Health Conditions Dashboard helps to give an insight to the users namely patients, family members of the admitted patients, and the healthcare management and the staff members about the data used by our Chatbot. In addition, the Sentiment Analysis Dashboard helps to give an insight into patients' experiences with the help of sentiment analysis performed on tweets filtered according to relevancy of patient's experiences and these six classes which are as follows: 
* Common Procedures
* Emergency Care
* Hospital Staff
* Medical Facillity 
* Treatment
* Null 

Sentiment analysis is performed on these tweets and according to their sentiments these tweets are classified into three categories namely: 
* Neutral
* Positive
* Negative
