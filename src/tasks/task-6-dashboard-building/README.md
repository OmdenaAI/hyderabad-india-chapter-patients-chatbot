[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JFwGIzCduIE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwGIzCduIE)

In this Dashboard the Health Conditions helps to give an insight to the users namely patients, family members of the admitted patients and the healthcare management and staff members about the data used by our Chatbot. Inaddition, the Sentiment Analysis Dashboard helps to give an insight into patients experiences with the help of tweets on which sentiment analysis has been performed and the tweets are categorized into three categories namely: Neutral, Positive and Negative.

## Completed Tasks
* Completion of the Dashboard Health Conditions Design for Showcasing and explaining the data used by the chatbot for User Group A: the patients and the family members of patients which are in direct contact with our chatbot.
* Completion of the Dashboard Tweets design layout to help explain the nature of the tweets which indicates the patient's experience and performing sentiment analysisa to categorize them into three categories namely Neurtal, Positive and Negative.
* Identified Solutions with the help of team members to Questions raised in the weekly meetings as deliverables and brainstormed different ideas and ways to represent data on dashbaord.

## Future Scope:
* Implementing Age based filters using actions that will change dynamically according to the filter selected in Tableau instead of the current hardcoding of all the columns bounded to age being showcased at the same. However, this requires time as it will require implementing actions in tableau and we need to code certain features to show up and specific features to hide at the time of selection.
* Getting more data and expanding the dataset used by the chatbot and getting keyinsights that would help better explain the chatbot underlying data to Healthcare Management for business usecase.

## Data Used in dashboard Building: 
1. For the Creation of Health Conditions Dashboard we utilized the Health-Conditions.csv
