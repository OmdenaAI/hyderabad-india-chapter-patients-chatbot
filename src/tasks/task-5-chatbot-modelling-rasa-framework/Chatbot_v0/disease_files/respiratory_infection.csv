,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : What Is a Lower Respiratory Tract Infection?,"Lower RTI :Lower Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) are infections that affect the airways (below the level of the larynx), including the trachea and the alveolar sacs."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : Types of lower respiratory infections,"Lower RTI :Lower respiratory tract infections include:
bronchitis ,pneumonia ,bronchiolitis ,tuberculosis"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : Causes of lower respiratory infections,"Lower RTI :The number one cause of lower respiratory tract infections are viruses that invade the respiratory tract. Bacteria are the next most common cause. 

In bronchitis, the most common viruses are influenza (“the flu”) and the rhinovirus (which causes the common cold). 
The most common cause of pneumonia varies by age, but it can be due to a virus or bacteria. 
The most common causes of bronchiolitis are rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human metapneumovirus. 
More recently, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) can cause lower respiratory tract infections and sometimes lead to pneumonia. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : Symptoms of lower respiratory infections,"Common symptoms of all lower respiratory tract infections are cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Depending on the type of illness, your age, and other medical problems, these symptoms can range from mild to severe. 

The symptoms of bronchitis include cough, muscular chest pain, fatigue, and mild shortness of breath. A bronchitis cough can be dry or bring up mucus. The cough usually lasts 1-3 weeks and is the last symptom to go away. Bronchitis symptoms are often mild enough to be treated at home. But, in a person with a lung condition like asthma or COPD, it can lead to a severe illness needing hospitalization. Older age, having a weaker immune system, and smoking increase the chances of severe illness. 

The symptoms of pneumonia are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. A viral pneumonia has a more dry cough (without mucus), and the symptoms tend to be mild to moderate. Bacterial pneumonia is more likely to cause more severe symptoms, such as fever and cough with mucus. Viral pneumonia tends to go away on its own, while bacterial pneumonia gets worse without antibiotic treatment. 

People 5 years and older can get a type of pneumonia called “walking pneumonia,” where symptoms are dry cough, muscle aches, and fatigue. The name “walking pneumonia” comes from the fact that most people have mild to moderate symptoms and are able to walk around. 

Bronchiolitis usually starts as a common cold in the first 2-3 days. Symptoms include nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, and, sometimes, a fever. On days 3-5, the illness will reach its peak severity. At this stage, a child may start breathing faster than normal, using their rib and neck muscles to breathe, and having trouble feeding and playing. If these symptoms happen, the child needs to be seen by a doctor immediately. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : Diagnosing and treating lower respiratory tract infections,"Lower RTI :In most cases, lower respiratory tract infections can be diagnosed clinically. This means that a healthcare provider can make the diagnosis by asking about your symptoms and listening to your lungs. More testing or imaging is not always needed. That said, a chest X-ray may be needed to diagnose pneumonia when listening to the lungs on a physical exam may not be enough. 

In some cases, nasal swabs that detect respiratory viruses can be done to find the cause of the lower respiratory tract infection. Because viral testing is expensive and does not usually change treatment, a nasal swab is not typically done. "
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lower RTI : Lower respiratory infections vs. upper respiratory infections,"Lower RTI :The difference between lower respiratory tract infections and upper respiratory tract infections is the location of the infection and symptoms. The upper respiratory tract is made up of the nose, sinuses, throat, and voice box. Symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections include sneezing, runny nose, sore throat, and sinus pressure. Like lower respiratory infections, upper respiratory tract infections are mostly caused by viruses. "
